          <li class = "pglink"> <a href = "https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html" class = "pglink"> Question 1</a>: What is a good definition of copyright? </li>
        <br>
          <li class = "pglink"> ANSWER: Copyright is a form of protection grounded in the U.S. Constitution and granted by law for original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Copyright covers both published and unpublished works.</li>
          <br>
          <li class = "pglink" ><a href = "https://copyrightalliance.org/ca_faq_post/what-is-copyright/" class = "pglink"> Question 2</a>: What are the three basic requirements that a work must meet to be protected by copyright? </li>
        <br>
          <li class = "pglink"> ANSWER: Original: To be original, a work must merely be independently created. In other words, it cannot be copied from something else. There is no requirement that the work be novel (as in patent law), unique, imaginative or inventive.
Creative: To satisfy the creativity requirement a work need only demonstrate a very small amount of creativity. Very few creations fail to satisfy this requirement.
Fixed: To meet the fixation requirement, a work must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Protection attaches automatically to an eligible work the moment the work is fixed. A work is considered to be fixed as long as it’s sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. </li>

         <br>
          <li class = "pglink"> ANSWER: Penalties for copyright infringement can be quite severe, depending on the nature of the offense. These can include fines of up to $150,000 in the U.S. and $1 million in Canada, plus attorney and court costs. Additionally, any items that violate copyright can be impounded, and the offender may be eligible for jail time. </li>

          <br>
          <li class = "pglink"> ANSWER: To determine whether a work is in the public domain and available for use without the author’s permission, you first have to find out when it was published. Then apply the following rules to see if the copyright has expired:

All works published in the United States before 1924 are in the public domain.
Works published after 1923, but before 1978 are protected for 95 years from the date of publication. If the work was created, but not published, before 1978, the copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.
For works published after 1977, the copyright lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. However, if the work is a work for hire (that is, the work is done in the course of employment or has been specifically commissioned) or is published anonymously or under a pseudonym, the copyright lasts between 95 and 120 years, depending on the date the work is published.
Lastly, if the work was published between 1924 and 1963, you must check with the U.S. Copyright Office to see whether the copyright was properly renewed. If the author failed to renew the copyright, the work has fallen into the public domain and you may use it. </li>
