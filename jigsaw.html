       In this activity you will work in a group of five students. Each of you will become an "expert" at one type of factoring.
After becoming an expert, you will present and teach your group your method of factoring.

<h2>
Directions
</h2> 

<ol>
  <li class = "disability">
  Get into your groups of three students.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
  Each member will be assigned a number 1 to 3. This number is the number of the expert group that the member is assigned to.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
    Use the table below to find what group of people goes along with your expert group number.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
    Use the resource links to study your topic.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
    Next, join a new group composed of the other "experts" with your same number/type of people during the French Revolution. Discuss this with your expert group and answer any questions.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
    Lastly, return to your original class groups. Each student will get a turn to teach their group of people to their
class group.
  </li>
  <li class = "disability">
    Once all groups are finished, the class will have a quiz on the groups of people in the French Revolution.
  </li>
</ol>
